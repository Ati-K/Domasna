The prominent Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle affirmed that music contained an intrinsic
element that was conducive to the promotion of moral or spiritual harmony and order in the soul. Plato
and his contemporaries attributed specific character-forming qualities to each of the individual harmonia,
or musical modes, believing that each could shape human character in a distinct way. 

These ideas inevitably persisted and continue to endure. Theorists throughout history have agreed that music
profoundly influences human character and shapes morality.
